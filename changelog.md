# Change Log

### 1.0.4 2020-06-20

Switched everything to use the `cmake_find_package` generator in Conan exclusively after [because it's not worth it](https://github.com/TimSimpson/lp3-sdl/issues/5). I've now tested the CMake and this project appears to work with both the BinCrafter's SDL2 and vcpkg SDL2 packages, though for my own sanity the later isn't yet tested in CI...

### 1.0.3 2020-06-09

Adds a hack to the CMake package config file which detects if the Conan a Find Module generated by Conan's `cmake_find_package` generator has been used to load SDL2, and if so, makes an alias target from `sdl2::sdl2` to the version Lp3 SDL needs.
